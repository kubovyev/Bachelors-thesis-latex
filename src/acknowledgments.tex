\section*{Acknowledgments}

Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Ing. Matou≈° Vrba for his great support and providing all the necessary information during writing this thesis. I'm grateful to the MRS team for guiding me during the experiments.

I would also like to thank my parents, who made it possible for me to study at CTU in Prague and for their support. 

Finally, I would like to express my respect and deep gratitude to my friends, relatives and other people who now, no matter what, defend their home and democracy in Ukraine.
