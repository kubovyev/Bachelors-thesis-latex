The problem of trail following using image from monocular camera, attached to an unmanned drone or ground vehicle is tackled in this thesis. A system solving the task of flying through the forest along the man-made dirt trail is presented. It is accomplished by using a classification deep convolutional neural network for determining which direction is the camera pointed, relative to the trail. It was implemented to run in real-time onboard MRS multi-rotor drone. Performance and robustness was tested in simulations, followed by real-world experiments. The implemented system showed good practical results and can be used as a starting point for more complex navigation and surveillance applications.
